#Advertisement Click Recommender System

This project implements a recommender system for advertisements based on click data. It utilizes the Surprise library (which provides collaborative filtering algorithms for recommendation tasks) for building and evaluating recommender systems. Data analysis and visualization are performed using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib. Moreover, SVD algorithm is used to train the model and make predictions. The recommender system suggests advertisements to users based on their interactions.
